1.3 Project Goals
Create a robust system to store and manage employee data.
Implement functionalities for adding, searching, sorting, and exporting employee records.
Provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with employee data.
1.4 Project Audience
This project targets HR departments and administrators who need a reliable tool for managing employee records efficiently.

2. Story

2.1 The Analytical Software Engineer
You've recently joined a progressive tech firm as an Analytical Software Engineer. On your first day, your manager assigns you a critical task: to develop an Employee Management System that can handle and analyze employee data effectively.

The company, expanding rapidly, needs a robust system to manage employee records, facilitate HR analytics, and ensure smooth operations across departments. Your mission is to create a Java application that meets these requirements, providing essential functionalities for manipulating and querying employee data.

3. Requirements

3.1 Functional Requirements
Employee CRUD Operations:

Add new employees with attributes such as name, ID, salary, and years worked.
View a list of all employees with their details.
Update employee information (salary, years worked).
Delete employees from the system.
Search and Query:

Search for employees by name, ID, salary range, or years worked.
Filter employees by department or manager.
Sorting:

Sort employees alphabetically by name or numerically by salary or years worked.
Exporting Data:

Export employee records to JSON format.
Optional: Implement additional export formats like CSV or XML.
3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

System should handle large datasets efficiently (up to 1,000 employees).
Operations such as sorting and searching should be optimized for speed.
User Interface:

Intuitive and easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX.
Clear navigation and feedback on operations.
Security:

Basic authentication (login/password) to access the application.
Data encryption for sensitive employee information (optional).
4. Implementation

4.1 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
User Interface: JavaFX (recommended for modern UI)
Data Serialization: JSON (for storing employee records)
4.2 High-Level Design
Main Application Class: Handles initialization and setup.
Employee Class: Represents an employee with attributes (name, ID, salary, years worked).
EmployeeManager Class: Manages operations (add, delete, update, search, sort) on employee records.
User Interface: GUI for interacting with employee data (forms for adding/updating, tables for viewing/searching).
4.3 Data Storage
Employee records stored in-memory during application runtime.
Option to serialize/deserialize employee data to/from JSON file (employee_records.json).
5. Testing

5.1 Unit Testing
Test each functionality (add, delete, update, search, sort) using JUnit or similar testing frameworks.
Test edge cases such as empty lists, single item lists, and maximum capacity lists.
5.2 Integration Testing
Test interaction between user interface components and backend logic.
Ensure smooth integration of sorting, searching, and data export functionalities.
6. Deployment

6.1 Packaging
Package application into executable JAR file for easy distribution and deployment.
6.2 User Documentation
Provide user manuals and guides for installation, usage, and troubleshooting.
Include screenshots and step-by-step instructions for common tasks.
7. Conclusion

The Employee Management System aims to streamline HR processes by providing a comprehensive tool for managing employee data efficiently. By adhering to the outlined requirements and design principles, this project will contribute significantly to the company's operational efficiency and data management practices.
